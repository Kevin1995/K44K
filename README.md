Cryptography Algorithm - MSc Cyber Security Thesis

This algorithm was created by myself for my Master Thesis.

It involves an algortithm designed around a 4x4x4 Cube and a slight modification of the AES algorithm.

It was designed to function for IoT devices, but the code is a WIP and can be improved going forward.

(BIGGER EXPLAINATION WILL BE GIVEN SOON)
